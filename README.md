Online Word Counter - MIT Lab Week 11

This project is supposed to be challenging and useful for people learning javascript.<br/><br/>

Yet another online word counter, right? Well, yes. I always wondered how much code it was needed for this type of online applications, and this is it!

It was build using plain javascript.
It uses Bootstrap as a starting point for styles.
